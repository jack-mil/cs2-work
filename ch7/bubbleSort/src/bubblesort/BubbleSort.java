// Chapter 7, Exercise 7.20: Descending Bubble Sort
// Take 10 doubles and sort them in descending order

/* NOTE
* Exercise 7.20 is not about selection sort, as indicated in Canvas. Instead,
* it involves Bubble Sort. The text is below. I wrote to Jeff Sanford asking
* if this was a mistake, but didn't hear back from him in time. I hope this
* assignment is all right. Wasn't sure what to follow.
* 
* Exercise 7.20 from page 304:
* (Descending Bubble Sort) Modify the bubble sort method of 
* Programming Exercise 7.18, and sort the elements in the array in descending
* order instead of ascending order. Write a test program that reads 10 double
* numbers, invokes the method, and displays the sorted numbers in descending order
